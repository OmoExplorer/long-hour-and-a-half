*ALongHourAndAHalf Vers. 1.2
*Date of Version: 5/27/2017
*Time of Version: 22:08
*
*Dev: Rosalie Elodie
*
*Version History:
*0.1: Default game mechanics shown, non interactable. No playability, no customization. Not all game mechanics even implemented, purely a showcase program.
*0.2: MASSIVE REWRITE! (Thanks to Anna May! This is definitely the format I want!)
*1.0 Added interactivity, improved code, added hardcore mode(this isn't working now) and... cheats!
*1.1 Reintegrated the two versions
*1.2 New hardcore features:
*       Classmates can be aware that you've to go
*       Less bladder capacity
*    Improved bladder: it's more realistic now
*    Balanced pee holding methods
*    New game options frame
*    Even more clothes
*    Cleaned and documented code a bit
*
*
*A Long Hour and a Half (ALongHourAndAHalf) is a game where
*one must make it through class with a rather full bladder.
*This game will be more of a narrative game, being extremely text based,
*but it will have choices that can hurt and help your ability to hold.
*Some randomization elements are going to be in the game, but until completion,
*it's unknown how many.
*
*Many options are already planned for full release, such as:
*Name (friends and teacher may say it. Also heard in mutterings if an accident occurs)
*Male and Female (only affects gender pronouns (yes, that means crossdressing's allowed!))
*Random bladder amount upon awaking (Or preset)
*Choice of clothing (or, if in a rush, random choice of clothing (will be "gender conforming" clothing)
*Ability to add positives (relative to holding capabilities)
*Ability to add negatives (relative to holding capabilities)
*Called upon in class if unlucky (every 15 minutes)
*Incontinence (continence?) level selectable (multiplier basis. Maybe just presets, but having ability to choose may also be nice).
*
*
*Other options, which may be added in later or not, are these:
*Extended game ("Can [name] get through an entire school day AND make it home?") (probably will be in the next update)
*Better Dialog (lines made by someone that's not me >_< )
*
*
*If you have any questions, or want to shove code in her face,
*be sure to send them to Rosalie at her following email address:
*rosalieelodiedev@gmail.com
*(without caps)
*RosalieElodieDev@gmail.com
*(with caps)
*
*She also goes by the terrible username "Justice" on Omo.org
*(omorashi.org)
*and you're free to contact her there!
*(If you already have an account there, it's much more preferable ^^; )
*
*FINAL NOTE: While this is created by Rosalie Dev, she allows it to be posted
*freely, so long as she's creditted. She also states that this program is
*ABSOLUTELY FREE, not to mention she hopes you enjoy ^_^
*
*
*DEV NOTES: Look for bugs, there is always a bunch of them
*Bugs:
