# long-hour-and-a-half
A Long Hour and a Half is an Omorashi-themed game.
A Long Hour and a Half is a game where one must make it through class with a rather full bladder. This game is narrative, being extremely text based, but it have choices that can hurt and help your ability to hold.

Future features:
<br>
 - [ ] Extended game ("Can [name] get through an entire school day AND make it home?") (probably will be in the next update)
 - [ ] Better Dialog (lines made by someone that's not me >_< )
 - [ ] Story editor (players can create their own stories and play them)
 - [ ] Wear editor (players can create their own wear types and use it in A Long hour and a Half and custom stories
 - [ ] Save/load game states
 - [ ] Character presets
