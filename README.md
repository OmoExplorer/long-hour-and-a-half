# A Long Hour and a Half, an Omorashi-themed game Â 
A Long Hour and a Half is a game where one must make it through class with a rather full bladder. 
This game is narrative, being extremely text based, but it have choices that can hurt and help your ability to hold.

## 2.0 branch
I decided to try to rewrite the game on Python because it's easier than Java or Kotlin and more suitable for making games.
Also the game mechanics will be completely changed.
