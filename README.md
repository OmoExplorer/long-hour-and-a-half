# A Long Hour and a Half, an Omorashi-themed game Â 
A Long Hour and a Half is a game where one must make it through class with a rather full bladder. 
This game is narrative, being extremely text based, but it have choices that can hurt and help your ability to hold.

## 2.0 branch
I decided to try to rewrite the game on Python because it's easier than Java or Kotlin and more suitable for making games.
Also the game mechanics will be completely changed.

## Main branches
### 2.0
Branch where I create something like a "A Long Hour and a Half 2". Changes:
- Completely rewriting the game on Python programming language
- Total gameplay change
This version is in development and not ready to production yet, but it's playable.
You can try it out by downloading code ZIP, unpacking and running `start.py`. Make sure that you have the last version of Python installed on your machine.
You can install it [here](https://python.org) .
