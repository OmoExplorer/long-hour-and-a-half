# long-hour-and-a-half
###A Long Hour and a Half is an Omorashi-themed game.
A Long Hour and a Half is a game where one must make it through class with a rather full bladder. This game is narrative, being extremely text based, but it have choices that can hurt and help your ability to hold.

Future features:
<br>
Extended game ("Can [name] get through an entire school day AND make it home?") (probably will be in the next update)
<br>
Better Dialog (lines made by someone that's not me >_< )
